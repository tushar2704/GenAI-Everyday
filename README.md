=========================================

A repository dedicated to exploring, experimenting with, and applying Generative AI concepts and tools in practical, everyday scenarios. Whether you're learning, building small tools, or just curious about how GenAI can be integrated into daily tasks, this is the place to share and discover.

## ✨ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

*   **Demystify GenAI:** Break down complex concepts into understandable, practical examples.
*   **Share Practical Applications:** Showcase how GenAI can be used for common tasks (writing, coding, image creation, brainstorming, etc.).
*   **Foster Learning:** Provide a space for personal learning notes, code snippets, and prompt examples.
*   **Encourage Experimentation:** Serve as a sandbox for trying out different models, APIs, and techniques.
*   **Build a Collection:** Curate useful prompts, scripts, and resources related to everyday GenAI use.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository might contain a variety of resources, potentially organized like this (***Please update this section based on your actual content!***):

*   **/prompts:** A collection of effective prompts for various tasks (e.g., email drafting, creative writing, code explanation, image generation).
    *   `/prompts/chatgpt`
    *   `/prompts/claude`
    *   `/prompts/stable-diffusion`
*   **/code-examples:** Simple scripts or notebooks demonstrating how to interact with GenAI APIs or libraries.
    *   `/code-examples/python/openai-api`
    *   `/code-examples/python/huggingface-transformers`
*   **/tutorials:** Step-by-step guides on specific GenAI tasks or tools relevant to everyday use.
*   **/use-cases:** Examples and discussions of how GenAI was applied to solve a specific, practical problem.
*   **/resources:** Links to useful articles, tools, APIs, and other learning materials.
*   **/notes:** Personal study notes or summaries on GenAI topics.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tushar2704/GENAI-EVERYDAY.git
    cd GENAI-EVERYDAY
    ```
2.  **Explore the directories:** Browse the folders listed above (`/prompts`, `/code-examples`, etc.) to find resources relevant to your interests.
3.  **(Optional) Set up environment (if running code):** If you plan to run Python examples, you might need to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install requirements (if a requirements.txt file exists)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Use the resources:** Copy prompts, adapt code snippets, and follow tutorials for your own projects or learning.
